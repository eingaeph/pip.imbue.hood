# Project pip.imbue.hood 

  Derive illustrative code snippets from kilo.c, making minimal 
  modifications. Illustrate library function calls sufficient to 
  display and edit text files without further dependencies. 
  Incorporate code snippets in explanatory html pages stored in 
  tutor.zip.

  Prototype code kilo.c contains a copyright notice (2016). Code 
  is licensed by Salvatore Sanfilippo under terms which are here 
  incorporated as LICENSE.md. 

  http://viewsourcecode.org links to a valuable tutorial by Jeremy.Ruten
  who works with Sanfilippo's code. Ruten works at a deep level and 
  renders this work a partial redundancy, but possibly his work is 
  not directly usable for project pip.imbue.hood purposes. The project 
  goal may be described as that of achieving a primary school 
  understanding of kilo.c whereas Ruten works at the high school level, 
  at the least.
