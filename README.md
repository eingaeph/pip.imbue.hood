# Project pip.imbue.hood 

  Extract illustrative code snippets from kilo.c, making minimal 
  modifications. Illustrate library function calls sufficient to 
  display and edit text files without further dependencies (Linux
  environment). Incorporate illustrative code snippets in 
  explanatory html pages stored in tutor.zip.

  Prototype code kilo.c contains a copyright notice (2016). Code

  http://viewsourcecode.org links to a valuable tutorial by Jeremy.Ruten
  who works with Sanfilippo's code http://github/antirez/kilo
. Ruten works at a deep level and 
  renders this work a partial redundancy, but possibly his work is 
  not directly usable for this project's (pip...) purposes. The project 
  goal may be described as that of achieving a primary school 
  understanding of kilo.c whereas Ruten works at the high school level, 
  at the least.

  Proposed Outline:
  
  A. Trace representative source executables to the writing of
     the first screen

  B. Add coding (UPD format) to count the calls to abAppend

  C. Add coding (UPD format) to file save the character string for the 
     first screen write.
