# Project pip.imbue.hood 

  As necessary build illustrative code snippets to support 
  minimal readability mods to kilo.c. Illustrate library function 
  calls sufficient to display and edit text files without further 
  dependencies in a Linux environment. Construct explanatory html
  pages stored in tutor.zip.

  Prototype code kilo.c by Salvatore Sanfilippo is hosted at
  http://github.com/antirez/kilo.

  Lausler's code https://github.com/pklausler/aoeui is an alternative
  prototype built to very similar specifications of length and
  dependencies and has been used by the author. 

  The prototype code contains a copyright notice (2016). licensed by 
  Salvatore Sanfilippo under terms which are here incorporated as 
  LICENSE.md. 

  Vigliag has forked https://github.com/vigliag/kilo Sanfilippo's code 
  adding comments explaining coding decisions etc.

  http://viewsourcecode.org links to a valuable tutorial by Jeremy.Ruten
  who works with Sanfilippo's. Ruten works at a deep level and 
  renders this work a partial redundancy, but possibly his work is 
  not directly usable for the pip.. project's purposes. This project's
  goal is "achieving a primary school understanding of kilo.c"
  whereas Ruten works at the high school level, at the least.
  
  Tutorial Tasks Outline:

  A. Describe a Linux terminal as a Linux device consuming character
     strings and emitting keystroke (characters)

  B. Build a Do-See-Say table for the VT100 escape sequences 

  Coding Tasks Outline:
  
  A. Trace representative source executable statements to the writing of
     the first screen

     Code in UPD format to isolate supplemental edi

  B. Add coding (UPD format) to count the calls to abAppend

  C. Add coding (UPD format) to file save the character string for the 
     first screen write.

  D. Add coding to write the first screen incrementally, ie after each
     call to to abAppend. Insert a variable delay to allow a human to 
     see and follow what is going on.
