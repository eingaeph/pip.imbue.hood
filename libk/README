Directory libk contains the build path for subkilo library of functions. The build path
model may be thought of as slightly different from the git tree model. The build path 
emphasizes one trunk which while demonstrating success at various points of the build.
 
1. UVSE Set limits rows, cols for coordinates u and v. Test the values by writing 
   to the screen.

2. KEYP Encode keyboard data stream as full size digits instead of byte sized characters.

3. WARF Read an input file, then display a portion of the file to the screen.

4. MOCU Move cursor according to keyboard data stream 

5. EDAL Edit a line 

6. REPL Begin testing editor features

7. XLIN

Design Problem:
libFIRS and libSECO contain object decks with same name. Use the object deck from libSECO
ignoring the data in libFIRS. In this way keep different versions of a function at
different points of the build.

join the following with the short circuit link &&
cd FIRS
ar x libFIRS
cp -n *.o LAST
rm *.o
