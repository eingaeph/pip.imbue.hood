# Project pip.imbue.hood 

  Buuild illustrative code snippets to highlight a subset of idioms
  used in kilo.c  Illustrate GNU/Linux library calls sufficient to 
  display and edit text files without further dependencies. Construct 
  explanatory html pages stored in tutor.zip.

  The present work is explicitly not an attempt to fork kilo.c but is
  intended to support a first reading of kilo.c, while skipping past 
  some details. The project wishes to support kilo.c as a preliminary
  archive of working C idioms. 

  Prototype code kilo.c by Salvatore Sanfilippo is hosted at
  http://github.com/antirez/kilo.

  Lausler's code https://github.com/pklausler/aoeui is an alternative
  prototype built to very similar specifications of length and
  dependencies and has been used been proven useful (by the author)
  for years. 

  The prototype code contains a copyright notice (2016). It is 
  licensed by Salvatore Sanfilippo under terms which are here 
  incorporated as LICENSE.md. 

  Vigliag https://github.com/vigliag/kilo has forked Sanfilippo's code 
  adding comments explaining coding decisions etc.

  http://viewsourcecode.org links to a valuable tutorial by Jeremy.Ruten
  who works with Sanfilippo's code. Ruten works at a deeper level and 
  renders this work a partial redundancy. But possibly his work is 
  not directly usable for the this project. This project's
  goal is "achieving a teachable primary school understanding of kilo.c"
  whereas Ruten, at the least, works at the high school level.
  
  Code modifications to kilo.c in UPD format to reduce the temptation to 
  rewrite.

  Scaffold Code Snippets (SCAFFOLD.md)

  Modifications to kilo.c (UPD format)
  
  B. Trace representative source executable statements as tasks are
     carried out

  C. Add coding to count the calls to abAppend

  D. Add coding to file save the character string for later examination.

  E. Add coding to write the first screen incrementally, ie after each
     call to to abAppend. Insert a variable delay to allow a human to 
     see and follow what is going on.
